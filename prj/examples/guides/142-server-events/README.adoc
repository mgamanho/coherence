== Server-Side Events

This guide walks you through how to use server-side events, (also known as "Live Events"), within Coherence to listen
for various events on a Coherence `NamedMap` or `NamedCache`.

Coherence provides an event programming model that allows extensibility within a cluster
when performing operations against a data grid. The model uses events to represent observable
occurrences of cluster operations. The events that are currently supported include:

* Partitioned Cache Events – A set of events that represent the operations being performed against a
set of entries in a cache. Partitioned cache events include both entry events and entry processor events. Entry events
are related to inserting, removing, and updating entries in a cache.
Entry processor events are related to the execution of entry processors.

* Partitioned Cache Lifecycle Events – A set of events that represent the operations for creating a cache, destroying a cache,
and clearing all entries from a cache.

* Partitioned Service Events – A set of events that represent the operations being performed by a partitioned service. Partitioned
service events include both partition transfer events  and partition transaction events. Partition transfer events are related
to the movement of partitions among cluster members. Partition transaction events are related to changes that may span multiple
caches and are performed within the context of a single request.

* Lifecycle Events – A set of events that represent the activation and disposal of a ConfigurableCacheFactory instance.

* Federation Events – A set of events that represent the operations being performed by a federation service. Federation events include
both Federated connection events and federated change events. Federated connection events are related to the interaction of federated
participants and federated change events are related to cache updates.

NOTE: In this example we will not cover Federation Events.

Events are registered in the cache configuration against either a cache service or individual caches via cache mappings.
The classes are annotated to identify what types of events they will receive.

For more information on server-side events, see the {commercial-docs-base-url}/develop-applications/using-live-events.html#[Coherence] documentation.

NOTE: Please see {commercial-docs-base-url}/develop-applications/using-map-events.html[the Coherence documentation] for more information on client events.

=== What You Will Build

In this example you will run a number of tests that demonstrate the following features of server-side events including:

* Understanding where to declare interceptors in your cache config
* Listening for `cache events` related to mutations of cache data, and execution of entry processors
* Listening for `transfer events` related to partition transfers and loss events
* Listening for `partitioned cache events` related to creation, destruction and truncating of caches
* Listening for `lifecycle events` for `ConfigurableCacheFactory` instantiation

==== Running the Examples

This example comprises a number of tests showing various server-side events features.

1. Running each example

Each example can be run direct from the IDE, or can be run via executing the tests.
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean verify
----
+
or
+
[source,bash]

[#example-tests-1]
=== Review the Tests

The example code comprises a number of classes:

**Tests**

* `ServerCacheEventsTest` - tests for various cache events
* `ServerPartitionEventsTest` - tests for partition based events
* `AbstractEventsTest` - a class used by both tests which starts the clusters

**Model**

* `Customer` - represents a fictional customer
* `AuditEvent` - represents an audit event

**Interceptors**

* `AuditingInterceptor` - creates audit events after inserts, updates or removes on a cache
* `EntryProcessorAuditingInterceptor` - creates audit events after entry processor executions
* `UppercaseInterceptor` - a mutating interceptor that changes the `name` and `address` attributes to uppercase
* `ValidationInterceptor` - a mutating interceptor that optionally rejects updates if certain business rules are not met
* `TransferEventsInterceptor` - creates audit events after any partition transfers made
* `CacheLifecycleEventsInterceptor` - creates audit events after caches are created, truncated or destroyed
* `LifecycleEventsInterceptor` - logs a message when ConfigurableCacheFactories are activated or destroyed
